## Overview

These are **basic single-file Java programs** that I worked on during my free time and at school as an introduction to coding.

## Reflection and Future Goals

Over the past year, as I've continued learning and expanding my skills, I've realized that many of my GitHub projects could benefit from:

- **Improved Clarity:** Reorganizing project structure for better readability.
- **Better Organization:** Establishing a more intuitive root structure.
- **Comprehensive Code Comments:** Adding detailed comments to make the code easier to understand for others and myself.

## Focus on Current Projects

  
- 🗂️ **Improving Project Organization**  
  - Grouping related files into folders.
  - Using consistent naming conventions.
  - Learning constantly new ways to code better
